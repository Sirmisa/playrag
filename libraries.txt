what is the command for the ones that need installation

Of course. You can install all the required third-party libraries with a single pip command.

1. Install the Python Libraries

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
Bash

pip install playwright pandas numpy nltk rouge-score

2. Install Playwright Browsers

After the pip installation is complete, Playwright needs to download the browser binaries (for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit) that it uses for automation. Run this command:
Bash

playwright install

3. Download NLTK Data

Finally, the script uses the punkt tokenizer from NLTK for calculating the BLEU score. You need to download it by running this command:
Bash

python -m nltk.downloader punkt

After running these three commands, your environment will be fully set up to execute the evaluation script.
